  <h1>Setting up Node.js and VS Code for TypeScript Development</h1>

  <h2>1. Install Node.js</h2>
  <p>
    If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download it from the official website:
    <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org</a>. Make sure you download the LTS version.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Verify Node.js Installation</h2>
  <p>
    To verify that Node.js is installed correctly, open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
    <code>node --version</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    You should see the installed Node.js version printed on the console.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Install VS Code</h2>
  <p>
    If you haven't installed Visual Studio Code, you can download it from the official website:
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Select All Options in VS Code Setup (Very Important)</h2>
  <p>
    During the installation process of Visual Studio Code, make sure to select all the available options for a complete installation.
    This ensures that you have all the necessary features and extensions installed for a smooth development experience.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Install TypeScript and ts-node Package Globally</h2>
  <p>
    Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript and ts-node globally:
    <code>npm install -g typescript ts-node</code>
  </p>

  <h2>6. Verify TypeScript Installation</h2>
  <p>
    To verify that TypeScript is installed correctly, run the following command:
    <code>tsc --version</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    You should see the installed TypeScript version printed on the console.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Executing JavaScript and TypeScript Files</h2>
  <p>
    To execute a JavaScript file using Node.js, open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the file is located, and run:
    <code>node filename.js</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    To execute a TypeScript file using ts-node, open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the file is located, and run:
    <code>ts-node filename.ts</code>
  </p>

  <h2>8. Install Code Runner Extension</h2>
  <p>
    Install the "Code Runner" extension in Visual Studio Code from the Extensions Marketplace. You can find it by searching for "Code Runner".
  </p>
  <p>
    After installing the extension, you'll see a "play" icon in the top right corner of VS Code that allows you to run any code with a single click, provided you have their environment setup.
